Here's the original project description:

**How sensitive are future projections of Antarctic ocean circulation to model resolution?**

Ocean circulation around the Antarctic margins plays a key role in the global climate system by (i) ventilating the global abyssal ocean with newly formed dense waters, and (ii) bringing heat to the Antarctic ice sheet. Recent simulations run by our group show that the abyssal overturning circulation, which is fed by Antarctic dense water formation, is projected to decrease by 40% by 2050 due to freshwater input from ice melt (Li et al. 2023). The projected shutdown of Antarctic dense water formation also changes the ocean stratification around Antarctica in a way that allows warm waters to more easily access the continental shelf and adjacent ice shelf cavities. While the model used for the Li et al. 2023 projections is unique in its ability to realistically simulate dense water, there are still many small-scale processes it misses out on due to its ~4 km resolution. In this project, we will revisit the results of Li et al. 2023 with a higher resolution model (~2 km) to investigate how sensitive the projected shutdown of abyssal overturning circulation is to model resolution.
