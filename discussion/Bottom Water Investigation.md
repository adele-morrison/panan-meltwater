**Figure 1.** Ideal age tracer anomaly for a) the PanAntarctic model and b) ACCESS-OM2. The age anomaly is taken at the last day of the ten year analysis period, by subtracting the control experiment from the meltwater perturbation experiment. The black contour indicates the edge of the Antarctic continental shelf.

**Figure 2.** The surface water mass transformation integrated over the Antarctic shelf for a) the PanAntarctic meltwater and control experiments and b) the ACCESS-OM2 meltwater and control experiments.

**Figure 3.** Times series of the mean surface water mass transformation over the 25-75% dense water formation region (justified in Schmidt et al., 2025) for a) the PanAntarctic and ACCESS-OM2 meltwater and control experiments, and b) the PanAntarctic and ACCESS-OM2 anomalies between the control and meltwater perturbation. The mean surface water mass transformation over the DSW formation region was saved yearly, averaged for each year of the ten year analysis period.
