**Figure 1.** Ideal age tracer anomaly for a) the PanAntarctic model and b) ACCESS-OM2. The age anomaly is taken at the last day of the ten year analysis period, by subtracting the control experiment from the meltwater perturbation experiment. The black contour indicates the edge of the Antarctic continental shelf.
