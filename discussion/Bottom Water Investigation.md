**Figure 1.** Ideal age tracer anomaly for a) the PanAntarctic model and b) ACCESS-OM2. The age anomaly is taken at the last day of the ten year analysis period, by subtracting the control experiment from the meltwater perturbation experiment. The black contour indicates the edge of the Antarctic continental shelf.

**Figure 2.** The surface water mass transformation integrated over the Antarctic shelf for a) the PanAntarctic meltwater and control experiments and b) the ACCESS-OM2 meltwater and control experiments.

**Figure 3.** Times series of the mean surface water mass transformation over the 25-75% dense water formation region (justified in Schmidt et al., 2025) for a) the PanAntarctic and ACCESS-OM2 meltwater and control experiments, and b) the PanAntarctic and ACCESS-OM2 anomalies between the control and meltwater perturbation. The mean surface water mass transformation over the DSW formation region was saved yearly, averaged for each year of the ten year analysis period.

**Figure 4.** Surface water mass transformation anomaly per Antarctic Bottom Water formation region for a)-d) the PanAntarctic model and e)-h) ACCESS-OM2. The anomaly is taken over the entire ten year analysis period.

**Figure 5.** Bottom salinity anomaly for a) the PanAntarctic model, b) ACCESS-OM2, and c) as a time series for the PanAntarctic model and ACCESS-OM2. The salinity anomaly maps are averaged across the entire ten year analysis period. The black contour indicates the edge of the Antarctic continental shelf.

**Figure 6.** Bottom temperature anomaly for a) the PanAntarctic model and b) ACCESS-OM2. The temperature anomaly maps are averaged across the entire ten year analysis period. The black contour indicates the edge of the Antarctic continental shelf.
