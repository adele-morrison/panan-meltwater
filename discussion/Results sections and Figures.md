**1. Abyssal overturning shutdown**  
    Metrics: Changes in deep Southern Ocean temperature/salinity, Bottom water age, SWMT (Surface Water Mass Transformation).  
   
   1.1.

**2. Ocean temperature response**  
    Metrics: Temperature trends at different depths, heat content anomalies, regional breakdowns (e.g., Weddell, Ross, Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas).

**3. Strength of ASC**  
    Metrics: Isopycnal structures intersecting the continental shelf, Continental shelf heat budget, speed anomalies  



# Figures for thesis draft  

### Introduction
- Diagram of Antarctic shelf, with DSW formation, overturning, and ASC
- Diagram from Schmidt et al (2025) of resolution and mixing

### Method
- Where the boundaries of the four AABW formation regions are on a map

### Results

For abyssal overturning:  
- bottom salinity map
- bottom temperature map
- bottom water age map

- SWMT peaks (all models on same plot)
- Time series of SWMT anomaly for all models (Whole shelf or regional? Maybe all of the above)
- Bottom water age and SWMT for control and meltwater separately, side by side?
  
<br>
For ocean warming:  

- Mean shelf and slope response:
    - Depth-mean maps
    - Time series for slope and shelf in different regions
    - Temperature Hovmoller for the top 1000m for each model

<br>
For ASC:  

- Speed anomaly maps
- Westward transport over isobaths (see Fig 7 of Moorman et al (2020))

### Discussion
- Schematic of key responses (see Fig 12 of Moorman et al (2020))
