# Notebooks to prep
This is a list of the Juptyer notebooks to prepare for analysis whilst I am waiting for the new data.  
<br>  

Temperature:
- [ ] Bottom temperature map
- [ ] Hovmoller for shelf only (top 1000m)
- [ ] Time series of temperature on whole shelf 
- [ ] Time series of temperaure on whole slope - **figure out how**
- [ ] Time series for slope and shelf in different regions 
      
<br>

Salinity:
- [ ] Bottom salinity map
<br>

Abyssal overturning:
- [ ] Bottom water age map
- [ ] SWMT peaks whole shelf
- [ ] SWMT timeseries whole shelf
- [ ] SWMT peaks for formation regions separately
- [ ] SWMT timeseries for formation regions separately
- [ ] Bottom water age with SWMT of DSW overlayed on top
<br>

ASC:
- [ ] Speed anomaly maps
- [ ] Westward transport in different regions - **figure out how**
- [ ] Isopycnals shifting over time (think I know how)
- [ ] Continental shelf heat budget - **figure out how**
